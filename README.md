# JoshEngine 3.0+1.0
> *You can (NOT) have OpenAL support*

Hello ladies, gents, and fellows anywhere inbetween! 
Welcome to the amazing and wonderful home of JoshCo's *fourth attempt* (if you count my mistakes with just plain old C as a real JoshEngine version...) at a game engine!

Alright, I'll cut the theatrics now. 

This is the work we have to get done:

- [X] OpenGL working
- [X] GameObjects working
- [ ] OBJ models and removing duplicate vertices
- [ ] OpenAL sound working (the subtitle is mostly a joke about JE1 and 2, and eva rebuild reference of course)
- [ ] ChaiScript scripting support
- [ ] PYSON implementation because I said I'd do it for Liam so he would *merge the damn PR*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once everything above this line is done, the engine is ready for a beta!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- [ ] Python support
- [ ] Lua support
- [ ] Deeply refactor graphics backend to be a little more fluid and support multiple APIs
- [ ] OpenGL ES 2.0 for Emscripten+WebGL
- [ ] Vulkan (again)
- [ ] Metal and DX12
- [ ] Skinned animation support
